The functions described in the following files perform various operations:

0-puts_recursion.c: This file contains a function that recursively prints a string followed by a new line.

1-print_rev_recursion.c: Within this file, you can find a function that recursively prints a string in reverse.

2-strlen_recursion.c: Inside this file, there is a function that recursively calculates and returns the length of a string.

3-factorial.c: This file holds a function that calculates and returns the factorial of a given number.

4-pow_recursion.c: Here, you will find a function that recursively computes and returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

5-sqrt_recursion.c: Inside this file, a function is present that recursively calculates and returns the natural square root of a number.

6-is_prime_number.c: Within this file, a function is defined that determines whether an input integer is a prime number. It returns 1 if the number is prime and 0 otherwise.

100-is_palindrome.c: This file contains a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. It returns 1 if the string is a palindrome and 0 otherwise.

101-wildcmp.c: Here, a function is provided that compares two strings and determines if they can be considered identical. It utilizes the concept of wildcards. The function returns 1 if the strings are identical and 0 otherwise.

Additionally:

_putchar.c: This file contains the implementation of the _putchar function.

main.h: This is a header file that includes the function prototypes for all the functions defined in the other files.
